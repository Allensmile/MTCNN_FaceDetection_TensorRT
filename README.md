# MTCNN_TensorRT
MTCNN C++ implementation with NVIDIA TensorRT Inference accelerator SDK

This repository is based on https://github.com/AlphaQi/MTCNN-light.git

Now it is under building, I will implement MTCNN face-detection algorithum with NVIDIA TensorRT C++ API to get high performance on platforms such as NVIDIA TX2 or any PC with NVIDIA-GPUs.
